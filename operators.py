# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# a = 34
# b =545
# sum= a+b
# print(sum)


# a=43
# b =545
# sub= a-b
# print(sub)


# a=43
# b =545
# mul= a*b
# print(mul)

# a=43
# b =545
# div= a/b
# print(div)

#floor division

# x=5
# y=2

# floor= x%y
# print(floor) #vagsesh dekhabae

#assignment operator

# X =5
# X+=5

# print(X)

# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# X=5
# Y=3

# print(X==Y)

# x = 5
# y = 3

# print(x != y)

# returns True because 5 is not equal to 3


# x= 4
# y=56

# n=x>y
# print(n)


# A=4

# B=5

# print(A>B and B<A)


# N= 4

# print(3<N or 2<N)

# x =4

# print((x>3 and x<10))



# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# y = ["apple", "banana"]
# z = x


# print(x is z)

# print(x is y) # akhne false howar karon its not a same object in value comparison not same element

# print(x == y)  # to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is" and "==": this comparison returns True because x is equal to y


# n = ["apple","banana","orange"]
# o =["apple","banana","orange"]
# p =n


# print(n is not p)

# print( n is not o)

# print(n != p)


#Memberships Operator

x=["banana","sugercane"]

print("banana" in x)


x = ["orange","pancake"]

print("lion" is not x)
