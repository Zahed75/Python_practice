# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# a = 34
# b =545
# sum= a+b
# print(sum)


# a=43
# b =545
# sub= a-b
# print(sub)


# a=43
# b =545
# mul= a*b
# print(mul)

# a=43
# b =545
# div= a/b
# print(div)

#floor division

# x=5
# y=2

# floor= x%y
# print(floor) #vagsesh dekhabae

#assignment operator

# X =5
# X+=5

# print(X)

# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

X=5
Y=3

print(X==Y)

x = 5
y = 3

print(x != y)

# returns True because 5 is not equal to 3
